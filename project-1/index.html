<br/>

<br/>
Either you're noticed or left out
<br/>
Seven ways to get ahead
<br/>

<br/>

<p>Sit me down, shut me up
  <br/>
I'll calm down and I'll get along with you </p>
<p>There is a time when we all fail
  <br/>
Some people take it pretty well
<br/>

<br/>
Oooh ooooooh </p>
<p>Sit me down, shut me up
  <br/>
I'll calm down and I'll get along with you </p>
