# Technical Report for Project 1

I surf primarily on Google Chrome and Safari browsers; browsers serve users by providing access to the Internet and websites through the input of hmtl's and the use of search engines (accessible through html's).

On the Wayback Machine, I went all the way back to the year 1990, when the WorldWideWeb aka Nexus was first created. The snapshot contained a webpage and browser entirely in black and white, with very minimalistic design and primitive graphics and icons. Now, browsers and webpages are fully colored, and contain complex and creative designs and icons for nearly every aspect of the web.

My work process for this project was relatively simple; I coded the html page as instructed, and worked through some misunderstandings I previously held concerning relative URLs, which I now better and more fully understand through my own trial and error process!
Nothing was particularly difficult for this assignment, and I learned that html pages are a little more precise and contain more coding information than Markdown.
