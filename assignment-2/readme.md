## Assignment 2

A _version control system_ is one that records changes made to a file over time so that the user may fetch the history and review the steps they have taken. We are using this system in class to assist us in retracing our steps if and when necessary, and to record progress we have made in assignments.

For this project, I downloaded the GitHub Desktop Application so I could save my files to my computer and work separately from the website.
The only challenges that I discovered were identifying the relative URLS of the image and text file sources. I solved these simply by referring to the Intro to Web Dev website.
I learned that you can easily create text files within folders, something I had never needed to do before and thus never attempted. I also learned a more in-depth explanation and purpose of readme files, which have proven to be extensively helpful!
