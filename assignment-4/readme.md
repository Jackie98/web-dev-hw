# Assignment 4 Technical Report
Alt text serves as an alternate display of text that loads in place of an image if
an error occurs and the image is unable to be displayed. It helps users understand
the information the image was intended to represent.

A form of alt text I've personally seen was on a webpage designed by a professor for
their ENSC class as part of their lecture; the image had been improperly coded,
so the alt text was displayed instead, and gave me an idea of what the professor
had been attempting to communicate.

My work process for this project was long; I repeatedly had to return to fix errors
and clarify misunderstandings in the requirements. I experienced several issues
coding the selectio drop down menu, but was able to go back into the website and
find the resource necessary to correct this.
